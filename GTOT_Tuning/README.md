![Framework](GTOT-framework.png)


We would like to appreciate the excellent work of [Pretrain-GNNs](https://github.com/snap-stanford/pretrain-gnns) and [TransferLearningLibrary](https://github.com/thuml/Transfer-Learning-Library), which both 
lay a solid foundation for our work.

## Installation
We used the following Python packages for core development. We tested on `Python 3.7.6`.
```
pytorch                   1.4.0           
torch-geometric           1.6.0
torch-scatter             2.0.4 
torch-sparse              0.6.1
torch-spline-conv         1.2.0
rdkit                     2020.03.3.0
tqdm                      4.42.1
tensorboardx              2.1
```


## Dataset download
All the necessary data files can be downloaded from the following links.

For the chemistry dataset, download from <http://snap.stanford.edu/gnn-pretrain/data/chem_dataset.zip> (2.5GB), unzip it, and put it under `chem/dataset`.


## Train and test
#### Fine-tuning with GTOT Regularization 
```
sh chem/run.sh
```

#### Saved pre-trained models
The pre-trained models are under `model_gin/` and `model_architecture/`, copied from [Pretrain-GNNs](https://github.com/snap-stanford/pretrain-gnns) .
